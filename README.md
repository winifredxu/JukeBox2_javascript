# Overview

Let's make our Jukebox more user-friendly. Instead of automatically prompting the user for a song, we'll add a "Play" and only prompt the user for a song when this button is clicked.

# Tasks

1. Add jQuery to your Jukebox page. Make sure to load jQuery before any other Javascript files on your page.

2. Comment out the `promptAndPlay` functionality in `jukebox.js` so that the page no longer automatically prompts for songs.

3. Add a "Play" button to the page.

4. When the user clicks the "Play" button, the Jukebox should prompt the user to enter a song and play it. Implement this is `jukebox.js`

5. Disable the "Play" button while the song is playing. Make sure to re-enable it when the song is finished playing.

6. Change the "Play" button to read "Playing..." while the song is playing. Make sure to change it back to "Play" when the song is finished.
